# Aloha Apparel Project

A single-page, responsively-designed website for the fictional Aloha Apparel Co. The site features product categories and a sample of their most popular items. Tools used to build out the site include HTML & CSS, jQuery and Git.

This was the first project in which I implemented mobile-first design and it was tricky at first to understand which elements should be resized at each breakpoint. However, with practice it was become familiar and I see the value in this approach to web design, with it's flexibility and variety of style options. Using a slider was another first, and while it was fairly easy to add to the code, it took longer to style it properly for each screen size. Working on this project helped a great deal in understanding the use of Flexbox properties.
